Centos 7 DISA STIG
================

# We've Moved
 This project was a port of the RHEL6 STIG implimentaion designed and tested to work with CentOS 7.  It was created and maintained before the RHEL7 STIG was released... It represented the best ideas on how to harden CentOS *at the time*.  In the months since the last commit DISA *has* released the RHEL7 STIG and several teams have created ansible implementations that support both RHEL and CentOS.

 Please See: [https://github.com/PolarisAlpha/RHEL7-STIG](https://github.com/PolarisAlpha/RHEL7-STIG)

## Legacy Info

----

Configure Centos 7 machine to be DISA STIG compliant. CAT I CAT II and CAT III findings will be corrected by default. Findings can be enabled/disabled by setting the appropriate variable to enable those playbooks.

### WARNING
 There is no STIG for RHEL/Centos 7 yet, it is still in draft form... this playbook is based off the published RHEL6 STIG, and attempts to apply that to a Centos 7 system.
### WARNING

This role **will make changes to the system** that could break things. This is not an auditing tool but rather a remediation tool to be used after an audit has been conducted.

The role tries to be helpful and pause to let you know it found something. You can disable this behaviour if you want to run it unattended by setting `cent7stig_fullauto` to `true`.

## IMPORTANT INSTALL STEP

If you want to install this via the `ansible-galaxy` command you'll need to run it like this:

`ansible-galaxy install -p roles dsmorse.STIG-cent7,devel`

Based on [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 STIG Version 1 Release 6 - 2015-01-23](http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/os/unix-linux/Pages/index.aspx).

Inspiration and some config files taken from [RedHatGov](https://github.com/RedHatGov) [stig-fix-el6](https://github.com/RedHatGov/stig-fix-el6).

Example Playbook
-------------------------

Make sure to include the vars_prompt section in your playbook. It is needed for the tasks that set the grub password.

    - hosts: servers
      sudo: yes

      roles:
         - { role: cent7-STIG, cent7stig_cat1: true, cent7stig_cat2: true, cent7stig_cat3: false, cent7stig_update_packages: false, cent7stig_install_packages: true  }


Tags
----
Many tags are available for precise control of what is and is not changed. When running this playbook with tags, always include the `prelim_tasks` tag. This will run all the setup tasks that gather information and set variables used by subsequest tasks. If run without `prelim_tasks`, certain tasks may fail.

Some examples of using tags:

    # Don't run any unneeded audit tests (do it fast)
    ansible-playbook site.yml --skip-tags audit

    # Only remediate ssh
    ansible-playbook site.yml --tags= prelim_tasks,ssh

    # Don't change SNMP or postfix
    ansible-playbook site.yml --skip-tags= audit,postfix,mail,snmp
